# rolez-apps

A suite of [Rolez](https://github.com/rolve/rolez) applications.

To compile and run these, first install Rolez using `mvn install -DskipTests` in the directory
where you checked out the Rolez repository. (This is necessary because the apps in here have no
reference to the Rolez Maven repository.)

Then, type `mvn clean compile exec:java` in the directory of the application you want to run.
